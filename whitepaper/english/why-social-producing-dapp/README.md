# Why Social Producing Dapp?

{% embed url="https://zxyng.github.io/" %}

&#x20;Social Producing means a system that debuts and nurtures idols by evaluating individual activity videos of idols using group producer members. This is similar to the founding philosophy of Augur (https://www.augur.net/), which was introduced as an excellent example of successful ICO projects in the past.

In contrast to the traditional practice of having 1 or 2 idols debut experts   for each agency, Zxyng is a platform that serves as a single virtual agency, and is a system in which the collective intelligence of thousands to tens of thousands of people debuts hundreds to thousands of idols. .

&#x20;The predictive power of Zxyng's collective intelligence becomes more accurate over time than the predictive power of the brilliant few. This is the same principle that a giant AI gets stronger as it is trained and has more data. Zxyng also pursues transparency and fairness of evaluation and compensation by utilizing blockchain. One of the representative examples among the various experiments that proved this collective intelligence is the 'experiment to match the number of marbles in a glass bottle'. A professor asked a question to guess the number of marbles in a glass jar to a classroom of various people. As a result, among the numbers submitted by each individual, no number was closest to the actual number of marbles, but the average of the numbers submitted by each individual resulted in a value closest to the actual number of marbles. In other words, although the number guessed by the individual was far from the correct answer, the average of the values they inferred as a group was close to the correct answer.\


&#x20;In 1907, English geneticist Francis Galton (1822-1911) held a contest to guess the weight of a bull. He challenged 800 people in Plymouth Market to guess the weight of a slaughtered bull. He calculated the average weight of each person's guess, although no one guessed the exact weight. He had collectively weighed the bulls. The results were surprisingly much more accurate than the livestock experts' estimates. 100 years later, this situation was reproduced. Digital marketing expert Lior Zoref asked the public the same question at TED. Audiences sent in over 500 estimates. Surprisingly, the average was almost identical at 813 kg, just 1 kg less than the bull's weight.
