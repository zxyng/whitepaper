# Our Product

## How Business Model works

&#x20;Zxyng, a social producing platform, is a place that discovers and nurtures potential stars with a premonition of stars based on collective intelligence. Depending on the performance of participating in collective intelligence (number of evaluations, star prediction hit rate), a portion of the platform's quarterly revenue will be automatically settled. The main revenues of the platform will be generated from 1) AI-Dol sales revenue 2) Music distribution revenue 3) Digital item mall sales revenue 4) MCN revenue 5) Advertising 6) Goods sales.

### The Basics

&#x20;The evaluation policy for creators and collective producers and the compensation policy for creators and producers are all transparently, quickly and automatically executed by smart contracts.&#x20;

### Become an AI-dol creator member

&#x20;If you download the Zxyng app and choose from numerous AI-Dols or apply for a custom application through your photo, it will be sold and you will become a trainee. However, depending on the performance of activities for 3 months, you may be able to release your trainee status and debut, or it may be canceled. Depending on the activity performance for 3 months, you will be officially debuted as a celebrity. After that, the ability to form an idol group by teaming up with debuted soloists is supported. This too will borrow the power of the Collective Producer's Collective Intelligence. For collective intelligence, in the screening of each activity video, a quorum of at least 1,000 (based on a total of 5,000 producer members) participates, and if more than 70% of them agree, it becomes a decision.

### &#x20;Become a Producer Member of Collective Producer

&#x20;If you simply introduce yourself in 10 lines or less and get 50% of the votes in favor of 20% of existing group producers, you become a producer member. However, the initial total size is 5,000, and this may close early on a first-come, first-served basis.&#x20;
