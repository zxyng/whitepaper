# Social Producer Members

## Step 1 - Apply & Get Filtered or Get Invited

1. Single application: First, 'simple self-introduction within 10 lines' will be judged by the management team. After more than 10 people are selected, up to 100 people (1,000/10,000/100,000) are automatically selected when 51% of participants agree with 20% (15%/10%/5%) of producer members.
2. Receive invitation: If you have already been selected as a producer member, you can invite your trusted acquaintances to become producer members. However, when the star prediction rate is raised by collective intelligence like Augur, not only your own prediction rate is reflected in your performance, but also the prediction rate of the acquaintances you invited is reflected in your performance, so invite people with good touch.



## Step 2 - Vote For AI-Dol's Creator

&#x20;

1. AI-Dol creators will upload activity videos (singing videos, dancing videos, witty videos, etc.) from time to time. Producer members will be notified and a window of opportunity to vote will open on a first-come, first-served basis until a quorum is reached, and once the quorum is reached, they will no longer be able to vote on the video.
2. In this way, videos that have received more than 70% approval votes by collective intelligence are counted, and when one AI-Dol receives 70% or more votes in all 10 videos for 3 months, the corresponding AI-Dol is automatically Become a debut, open to the public, and have the right to gather fans.

&#x20;You get 1 point for each vote, and the sooner you vote, the more points you get based on the first-come-first-served basis. Proportionate to this point, a portion of the profits generated during a certain period of all income generated through the AI idols they voted for will be allocated. However, if the platform coin is listed later, you will be able to purchase the coin with your own point performance, so at this time, the profit share may be partially limited.
