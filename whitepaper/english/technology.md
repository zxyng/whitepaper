## **DEEP REAL**™ **AI**

### Create virtual characters that are more real than real

&#x20;Deep Real AI automatically and quickly creates and provides virtual human content based on generative artificial intelligence. You can create a virtual human face that fits your persona by analyzing the faces of stars from all over the world, such as KPOP idols as well as ordinary people of all ages. It is possible to express a realistic character as if it were a real person, and from 2023, research is being conducted to express not only the face but also the hairstyle, clothing, makeup, and pose in a realistic way.

### 1) Real-Time Face swap&#x20;

&#x20;With real-time face swap technology that can be used in various live broadcast situations such as online streaming, the usability of virtual humans will be expanded to the realm of real-time interaction. Creates a realistic face regardless of race, gender, or age, and learns the gaze processing and muscles of the face in the video to finely control the movement of the virtual person as in real life. Communication infrastructure and digital environments such as metaverse, AI, and blockchain continue to evolve with the rise of 5G, enabling real-time communication with fans through deep real technology.

### 2) Full Body Head talking animation without human actor

&#x20;Through ChatGPT, TTS (text to speech), and Speech to Face (Face prediction from speech signals) technologies, content creation is possible without a real human substitute actor guiding virtual idols. It is a groundbreaking technology that reduces the burden of entertainment companies that have to continuously provide a variety of content, creating more stable and attractive opportunities for production sites.

\
&#x20;'Eternity' is a virtual project girl group created with Deep Real AI technology. Also known as the ‘AI Heart Attack Challenge’, it consisted of 11 finalists selected through an ideal type test among 101 male and female virtual characters who gathered topics on social media. Eternity is an attractive virtual project girl group that has formed not only outstanding looks but also a world view, with 11 finalists selected out of 101 virtual characters created by AI learning character images from the 20 years of Korean idol history.

&#x20;So far, we have released sound sources and music videos such as 'I'm real', 'No filter', 'Paradise', and 'DTDTGMGN', and have been exposed to more than 300 domestic and international media since its launch. Virtual celebrities and virtual influencers that are newly emerging all over the world through Deep Real AI technology have limitations such as movement restrictions, long production periods, and high operating costs. However, 'Eternity' can be made at a more reasonable cost.

## Professional K-Pop Motion transformed into Avatar&#x20;

### Matching certification between choreography and original choreography creators secures a basis for royalties income for choreographers

&#x20;Compared to the influence that dancers have on music promotion in the video era, there was no income based on copyright for original choreography. So, we want to realize the choreography economy, which has been a long-cherished desire of dancers.

1. Securing reliability with a structure in which dancers must invite dancers to register choreography.
2. Choreography motion capture (We do it remotely or the choreographer does it him/herself at nearby local studio)&#x20;
3. Distribution and revenue share

## VS. Performance of choreography/composition/voice/lyric video production patents and prototype development by group pairwise comparison&#x20;

### It is possible to proceed with a tournament between videos from the round of 32, and a system that can produce the best output with a technology that can synthesize countless videos with a specific standard.

&#x20;For one virtual idol, it is possible to open a competition and proceed as a tournament for music or composition competition. You can have countless lyricist competitions with one song selected here, and you can have a final voice competition with the final selected sound source (the sound source where the lyrics flow). (Infinite multi-level network production system)
